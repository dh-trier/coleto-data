# Doyle1 sample data

The Doyle1 sample dataset for coleto consists of a very short passage from Arthur Conan Doyle's short story "[The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Mazarin_Stone)". Version 1 is the original, whereas version2 contains an intentionally altered version of the text for testing purposes. This dataset is primarily intended for a simple test of whether or not coleto runs at all and does not cover all possible kinds of textual phenomena.
